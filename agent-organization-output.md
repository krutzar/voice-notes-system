# LLM Agent Notes Organization Output
Below is the verbaitum output from the [example notes transcript](https://github.com/krutzar/voice-notes-system/blob/main/whisper-transcript-example.txt), fed into the [notes organizer agent](https://github.com/krutzar/voice-notes-system/blob/main/notes-organizer-agent.md) via Claud 3 Opus. 

Note: Sometimes you have to retry or re-prompt the agent to ensure notes are verbaitum.

I have categorized your notes into the following topics, preserving the original wording verbatim. I have also listed the tasks and to-dos mentioned in the notes.

Topic 1: Work and Productivity System
- "I need to better map out my system for work and productivity as skill improvement and look at researching what those skills are, like what the actual aspects of skills of being able to fucking focus on something are, and pass that, implement it into a daily journaling type system that allows me to iterate and improve on things."

Topic 2: Music Video Ideas
- "Impact music video idea job he's working and the thing where the bills rack up is the call center job for whatever that other music video idea that he had was."
- "Music video, get phone footage to turn into that home footage stuff of banks and other security looking places so that we can imply the robbery setup and also be able to tie that home movie looking footage in with the studio footage at the end."
- "Ideas for music video, make bills, referencing people he's worked with, jug, producer, etc."
- "On the time lapse for the Impact music video, have things get more and more cluttered and more and more things in front of the camera lens as the time lapse goes on. Generally, just having his apartment get more and more cluttered."

Topic 3: Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
- "Brazilian jiu-jitsu class this week, or today, I guess."
- "Details on the triangle, drive the heels down towards the mat, the detail that I learned overall notes for the triangle are heels down, drive the hips up, pull the head down, squeeze the knees together."
- "Brazilian jiu-jitsu teaching, break down everything into a one, two, three step for the beginners and then follow it up by adding detail."
- "Planning my next jiu-jitsu class, I want to have six minutes up front, three minutes each partner, one person drills something, then they switch, potentially give them feedback or potentially have them ask their partners to give feedback. Have this be with the theme of whatever I'm teaching that day, so if it's guard passing, have them do some sort of guard pass that they know and then we'll just go deeper. Maybe have them revisit it at the end, who knows."

Topic 4: Wedding Photography
- "Questions to ask photographer, payment, setup, deposit, etc."
- "Turn around timeline, how contracts work, engagement stuff, recommended timing on how long she needs to be there, anything else we need to get her information wise and turn in terms of planning, venue, etc."

Topic 5: Podcast
- "Podcast season two, I think it's time to do another season, or I guess season three, I think it's time to do another season when I find myself thinking about people I want to interview, questions I want to ask, etc. Not sure if I drop this one all at once this time."
- "People to talk to, my grandmother, Adnan, maybe talk to Philip again if we do another music video, maybe try and talk to Impact again."

Topic 6: Quotes and Reflections
- "Rick Rubin quote, we are on a distant metaphysical journey from the here to the now. The fuck does that even mean?"

Topic 7: Video Production
- "Pieces or building blocks of a video production or music video piece, broad from the foundational pieces down to the finer details, performing shots, story shots, b-roll, embellishments, etc."
- "Elegrating feedback cycle, don't actually go through step by step on the items that were requested on the round of feedback. They're going to anticipate the changes and just be checking off boxes and not actually focused on whether or not it made a better product."

Tasks and To-dos:
1. Research skills for better focus and productivity.
2. Implement a daily journaling system for skill improvement.
3. Attend a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu class.
4. Plan and structure the next Jiu-Jitsu class.
5. Ask the photographer questions about payment, setup, deposit, etc.
6. Gather information about wedding photography timelines, contracts, and planning.
7. Plan for the next podcast season, including potential guests and interview questions.
8. Get phone footage of banks and security-looking places for the music video.
